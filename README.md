## Auth Flow
1. Register â†’ server returns JWT + user object.  
2. Client stores token (e.g., `localStorage.setItem('token', token)`).  
3. Client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected requests.  
4. Server middleware verifies token and attaches user info (e.g., `req.user = { userId: decoded.id }`).
